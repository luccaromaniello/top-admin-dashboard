# The Odin Project: Admin Dashboard
[Admin Dashboard challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course structure.

## Solution

The solution is available at (coming soon).

## Instructions

By the time this challenge was completed, the core concepts of this challenge include:
- Recreate the provided design layout (`instructions/original-layout.png` in the repository). Although a pixel perfect match was not required, I chose to closely replicate it to focus on practicing CSS Grid layout techniques and better understand grid behavior, prioritizing structure over visual styling.

- Use only HTML and pure CSS (no frameworks or libraries), with a focus on CSS Grid.
- Responsive design is addressed in later projects, so mobile visualization was not considered.

## Observations
- The course gets regular updates from the open-source community, so things might look a little different now compared to when this project was done.
- The original project instructions can be found in the `instructions/original-instructions.png` file.
